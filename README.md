## ðŸŒ¼ Hello
Nice to meet you! I'm Mariana, a brazilian **iOS Developer with a design bachelor degree** that makes me really good at building pixel perfect screens :) <br>
I've been working with Swift (UIKit) about two years and totally love it. <br>
In my free time I feel honored to **contribute to open source projects** (like <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios">Firefox for iOS</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/misteu/VocabularyTraining">Flippy Learn app</a>)
