## 🌼 Hi there!

I’m Mariana, a Brazilian **iOS Developer with a Design degree**. For the past **4 years** I’ve been building iOS apps with **Swift (UIKit)**, coding and designing smooth and pixel-perfect user experiences.

I enjoy contributing to the open source community, with past contributions to:  
- [Firefox for iOS](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios)  
- [Flippy Learn app](https://github.com/misteu/VocabularyTraining)  

My published apps (using SwiftUI):  
- 🕋 [Salat: Prayer Times and Qibla](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/salat-prayer-times-and-qibla/id6749776841)
- 💻 [Idle Code Tycoon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/idle-code-tycoon/id6754207431)  

When I’m not coding, I’m usually sewing, solving jigsaw puzzles, building Lego or learning something new to bring into my projects.
